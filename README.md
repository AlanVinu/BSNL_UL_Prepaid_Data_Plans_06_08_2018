BSNL Prepaid Unlimited Data Plans(as of 06/08/2018) Analysis

I created this project as I was looking at the various prepaid unlimited data plans offered by my network(BSNL,India) and couldn't decide which would be best for my usage.

I gave preference to the plans as follows :

1. Highest Data Offered
2. Lowest Price
3. Highest Validity

The weighted ranks was calculated by finding how far from the mean value is the selected plan's value. Value higher than the mean would reflect as lower rank for the selected value(in the case of `Price per day`) or higher rank(`Days`,`3G Data per day`,`Data per month`).
I did the analysis using LibreOffice Calc and RStudio.
